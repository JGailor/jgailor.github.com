I recently attended a job fair put on by one of the new "developer bootcamps", where the current class has an opportunity to show off the final projects that they spent the last part of their programs building.  A coworker and I went with the hope finding a few potential hires to begin the interview process with, but with the expectation that they would be a junior person whom we could help mold into a software craftsmen.  Maybe I had the wrong idea about the program, but what I found was a bit frustrating and made it.  Based on this experience, I'm going to outline some of the issues that I felt I saw, and some suggestions for how those of you who may enter into one of these bootcamps can maximize what you get out of them and make yourself an attractive candidate for software companies:

* Clones, Clones Everywhere

  With a single exception, all of the projects that we saw were in the vein of "This is a copy of (AirBnB, Evernote, Etsy, Instagram, ...)". While some of these were impressive (the Evernote clone I saw was well done for a single developer working for two weeks), when we are looking at a candidate for a position we're looking for people who are creative problem solvers.  I found it rather frustrating that there was not some interesting, original problems that some of these students had in their heads that they didn't try to leverage their time in the program to start building prototypes of.  I don't have any insight as to whether the program pushed students towards just copying some existing product, but it was clearly the status-quo.

* The Standard Program Template

  I realize that ten weeks is only so long, and you can only cover so much material in that time.
