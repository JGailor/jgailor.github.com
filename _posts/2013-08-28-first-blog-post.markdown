Matt Swanson recently wrote a really amazing blog post called "Do things, write about it".  It referenced another blog post by Carl Lange which is worth following the link to (apparently well known).  I wanted to continue this blog-chain love letter to doing interesting things and talking to people about them, because while I think it's awesome advice, it can sometimes be hard for an industry full of introverts to reach and say "I did this, I think it's cool, and I'm interested in getting your feedback".

I come up with interesting ideas (or so I think) periodically, and often build a prototype and do some testing, get to the edge of putting it up on github and suggesting people go take a look at it, and then I hesitate and ultimately let it quietly get swept to the side. It's not that I think there's no value in what I built, but I have this deeply-rooted belief that instead of the constructive criticism I'd like to receive it will just basically be a litany of "Why would you even bother?".  This may just come from a long career on the Internet and a belief in the old adages that "it's easier to criticize than to create" and "people follow the path of least resistance".
